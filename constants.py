#This is a template to practice the "constants" subject 
#within my udemy course
#will work on it this afternoon 20220228

#As explained, mat constants, like pi, the hours in a day, or the boiling point of water is not set
#within python. if constants need to be used in a program, we need to assign the constant to a variable

#as shown below, i defined a couple of constants that was shown by the instructor.!
PI = 3.142
HOURS_IN_A_DAY = 24
WATER_BOILING_POINT = 100

#then, i printed those constants to confirm
print(PI)
print(HOURS_IN_A_DAY)
print(WATER_BOILING_POINT)
